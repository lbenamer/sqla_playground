    "## Object Relational Tutorial\n",
    "The SQLAlchemy Object Relational Mapper presents a method of associating user-defined Python classes with database tables, and instances of those classes (objects) with rows in their corresponding tables. It includes a system that transparently synchronizes all changes in state between objects and their related rows, called a unit of work, as well as a system for expressing database queries in terms of the user defined classes and their defined relationships between each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ORM is in contrast to the SQLAlchemy Expression Language, upon which the ORM is constructed. Whereas the SQL Expression Language, introduced in SQL Expression Language Tutorial, presents a system of representing the primitive constructs of the relational database directly without opinion, the ORM presents a high level and abstracted pattern of usage, which itself is an example of applied usage of the Expression Language.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is overlap among the usage patterns of the ORM and the Expression Language, the similarities are more superficial than they may at first appear. One approaches the structure and content of data from the perspective of a user-defined domain model which is transparently persisted and refreshed from its underlying storage model. The other approaches it from the perspective of literal schema and SQL expression representations which are explicitly composed into messages consumed individually by the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful application may be constructed using the Object Relational Mapper exclusively. In advanced situations, an application constructed with the ORM may make occasional usage of the Expression Language directly in certain areas where specific database interactions are required.\n",

    "## Declare a Mapping\n",
    "When using the ORM, the configurational process starts by describing the database tables we’ll be dealing with, and then by defining our own classes which will be mapped to those tables. In modern SQLAlchemy, these two tasks are usually performed together, using a system known as Declarative, which allows us to create classes that include directives to describe the actual database table they will be mapped to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes mapped using the Declarative system are defined in terms of a base class which maintains a catalog of classes and tables relative to that base - this is known as the declarative base class. Our application will usually have just one instance of this base in a commonly imported module. We create the base class using the declarative_base() function, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> Base = declarative_base()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now that we have a “base”, we can define any number of mapped classes in terms of it. We will start with just a single table called users, which will store records for the end-users using our application. A new class called User will be the class to which we map this table. Within the class, we define details about the table to which we’ll be mapping, primarily the table name, and names and datatypes of columns:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String\n",
    ">>> class User(Base):\n",
    "...     __tablename__ = 'users'\n",
    "...\n",
    "...     id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "...     name = Column(String)\n",
    "...     fullname = Column(String)\n",
    "...     nickname = Column(String)\n",
    "...\n",
    "...     def __repr__(self):\n",
    "...        return \"<User(name='%s', fullname='%s', nickname='%s')>\" % (\n",
    "...                             self.name, self.fullname, self.nickname)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A class using Declarative at a minimum needs a `__tablename__` attribute, and at least one Column which is part of a primary key 1. SQLAlchemy never makes any assumptions by itself about the table to which a class refers, including that it has no built-in conventions for names, datatypes, or constraints. But this doesn’t mean boilerplate is required; instead, you’re encouraged to create your own automated conventions using helper functions and mixin classes, which is described in detail at Mixin and Custom Base Classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When our class is constructed, Declarative replaces all the Column objects with special Python accessors known as descriptors; this is a process known as instrumentation. The “instrumented” mapped class will provide us with the means to refer to our table in a SQL context as well as to persist and load the values of columns from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of what the mapping process does to our class, the class remains otherwise mostly a normal Python class, to which we can define any number of ordinary attributes and methods needed by our application.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Tip\n",

    "\n",
    "The Declarative system, though highly recommended, is not required in order to use SQLAlchemy’s ORM. Outside of Declarative, any plain Python class can be mapped to any Table using the mapper() function directly; this less common usage is described at Classical Mappings.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we declared our class, Declarative used a Python metaclass in order to perform additional activities once the class declaration was complete; within this phase, it then created a Table object according to our specifications, and associated it with the class by constructing a Mapper object. This object is a behind-the-scenes object we normally don’t need to deal with directly (though it can provide plenty of information about our mapping when we need it).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Table object is a member of a larger collection known as MetaData. When using Declarative, this object is available using the .metadata attribute of our declarative base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MetaData is a registry which includes the ability to emit a limited set of schema generation commands to the database. As our SQLite database does not actually have a users table present, we can use MetaData to issue CREATE TABLE statements to the database for all tables that don’t yet exist. Below, we call the MetaData.create_all() method, passing in our Engine as a source of database connectivity. We will see that special commands are first emitted to check for the presence of the users table, and following that the actual CREATE TABLE statement:\n",

    "    PRIMARY KEY (id)\n",
    ")\n",
    "()\n",
    "COMMIT\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Minimal Table Descriptions vs. Full Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Users familiar with the syntax of CREATE TABLE may notice that the VARCHAR columns were generated without a length; on SQLite and PostgreSQL, this is a valid datatype, but on others, it’s not allowed. So if running this tutorial on one of those databases, and you wish to use SQLAlchemy to issue CREATE TABLE, a “length” may be provided to the String type as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Column(String(50))`\n",
    "The length field on String, as well as similar precision/scale fields available on Integer, Numeric, etc. are not referenced by SQLAlchemy other than when creating tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Firebird and Oracle require sequences to generate new primary key identifiers, and SQLAlchemy doesn’t generate or assume these without being instructed. For that, you use the Sequence construct:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sqlalchemy import Sequence\n",
    "Column(Integer, Sequence('user_id_seq'), primary_key=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# A full, foolproof Table generated via our declarative mapping is therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "class User(Base):\n",
    "    __tablename__ = 'users'\n",
    "    id = Column(Integer, Sequence('user_id_seq'), primary_key=True)\n",
    "    name = Column(String(50))\n",

    "```\n",
    "We include this more verbose table definition separately to highlight the difference between a minimal construct geared primarily towards in-Python usage only, versus one that will be used to emit CREATE TABLE statements on a particular set of backends with more stringent requirements"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### Session Lifecycle Patterns  \n",
    "The question of when to make a Session depends a lot on what kind of application is being built. Keep in mind, the Session is just a workspace for your objects, local to a particular database connection - if you think of an application thread as a guest at a dinner party, the Session is the guest’s plate and the objects it holds are the food (and the database…the kitchen?)! More on this topic available at When do I construct a Session, when do I commit it, and when do I close it?.\n",

    "This custom-made Session class will create new Session objects which are bound to our database. Other transactional characteristics may be defined when calling sessionmaker as well; these are described in a later chapter. Then, whenever you need to have a conversation with the database, you instantiate a Session:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> session = Session()\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above Session is associated with our SQLite-enabled Engine, but it hasn’t opened any connections yet. When it’s first used, it retrieves a connection from a pool of connections maintained by the Engine, and holds onto it until we commit all changes and/or close the session object."

    "## Adding and Updating Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "To persist our User object, we add() it to our Session:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> ed_user = User(name='ed', fullname='Ed Jones', nickname='edsnickname')\n",
    ">>> session.add(ed_user)\n",
    "```\n",
    "At this point, we say that the instance is pending; no SQL has yet been issued and the object is not yet represented by a row in the database. The Session will issue the SQL to persist Ed Jones as soon as is needed, using a process known as a flush. If we query the database for Ed Jones, all pending information will first be flushed, and the query is issued immediately thereafter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, below we create a new Query object which loads instances of User. We “filter by” the name attribute of ed, and indicate that we’d like only the first result in the full list of rows. A User instance is returned which is equivalent to that which we’ve added:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> our_user = session.query(User).filter_by(name='ed').first() \n",
    ">>> our_user\n",
    "<User(name='ed', fullname='Ed Jones', nickname='edsnickname')>\n",
    "```\n",
    "In fact, the Session has identified that the row returned is the same row as one already represented within its internal map of objects, so we actually got back the identical instance as that which we just added:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> ed_user is our_user\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "The ORM concept at work here is known as an identity map and ensures that all operations upon a particular row within a Session operate upon the same set of data. Once an object with a particular primary key is present in the Session, all SQL queries on that Session will always return the same Python object for that particular primary key; it also will raise an error if an attempt is made to place a second, already-persisted object with the same primary key within the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add more User objects at once using add_all():\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> session.add_all([\n",
    "...     User(name='wendy', fullname='Wendy Williams', nickname='windy'),\n",
    "...     User(name='mary', fullname='Mary Contrary', nickname='mary'),\n",
    "...     User(name='fred', fullname='Fred Flintstone', nickname='freddy')])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also, we’ve decided Ed’s nickname isn’t that great, so lets change it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> ed_user.nickname = 'eddie'\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Session is paying attention. It knows, for example, that Ed Jones has been modified:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> session.dirty\n",
    "IdentitySet([<User(name='ed', fullname='Ed Jones', nickname='eddie')>])\n",
    "```\n",
    "and that three new User objects are pending:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> session.new  \n",
    "IdentitySet([<User(name='wendy', fullname='Wendy Williams', nickname='windy')>,\n",
    "<User(name='mary', fullname='Mary Contrary', nickname='mary')>,\n",
    "<User(name='fred', fullname='Fred Flintstone', nickname='freddy')>])\n",
    "```\n",
    "We tell the Session that we’d like to issue all remaining changes to the database and commit the transaction, which has been in progress throughout. We do this via commit(). The Session emits the UPDATE statement for the nickname change on “ed”, as well as INSERT statements for the three new User objects we’ve added:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> session.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "`commit()` flushes the remaining changes to the database, and commits the transaction. The connection resources referenced by the session are now returned to the connection pool. Subsequent operations with this session will occur in a new transaction, which will again re-acquire connection resources when first needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at Ed’s id attribute, which earlier was None, it now has a value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> ed_user.id \n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the Session inserts new rows in the database, all newly generated identifiers and database-generated defaults become available on the instance, either immediately or via load-on-first-access. In this case, the entire row was re-loaded on access because a new transaction was begun after we issued `commit()`. SQLAlchemy by default refreshes data from a previous transaction the first time it’s accessed within a new transaction, so that the most recent state is available. The level of reloading is configurable as is described in Using the Session.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Session Object States\n",
    "As our User object moved from being outside the Session, to inside the Session without a primary key, to actually being inserted, it moved between three out of four available “object states” - transient, pending, and persistent. Being aware of these states and what they mean is always a good idea - be sure to read Quickie Intro to Object States for a quick overview."

    "### Common Filter Operators\n",
    "Here’s a rundown of some of the most common operators used in `filter()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### `equals`:\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "query.filter(User.name.like('%ed%'))\n",
    "```\n",
    ">Note\n",
    "ColumnOperators.like() renders the LIKE operator, which is case insensitive on some backends, and case sensitive on others. For guaranteed case-insensitive comparisons, use ColumnOperators.ilike().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### `ILIKE` (case-insensitive LIKE):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "query.filter(User.name.ilike('%ed%'))\n",
    "```\n",
    ">Note\n",
    "most backends don’t support ILIKE directly. For those, the ColumnOperators.ilike() operator renders an expression combining LIKE with the LOWER SQL function applied to each operand.\n",

    "* #### `IN`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "query.filter(User.name.in_(['ed', 'wendy', 'jack']))\n",
    "# works with query objects too:\n",

    "\n",
    "A number of methods on Query immediately issue SQL and return a value containing loaded database results. Here’s a brief tour:\n",

    "\n",
    ">#### /!\\ Warning /!\\\n",
    "When the Query object returns lists of ORM-mapped objects such as the User object above, the entries are deduplicated based on primary key, as the results are interpreted from the SQL result set.

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Textual SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Literal strings can be used flexibly with Query, by specifying their use with the text() construct, which is accepted by most applicable methods. For example, filter() and order_by():\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from sqlalchemy import text\n",
    "SQL>>> for user in session.query(User).\\\n",
    "...             filter(text(\"id<224\")).\\\n",
    "...             order_by(text(\"id\")).all():\n",
    "...     print(user.name)\n",
    "ed\n",
    "wendy\n",
    "mary\n",
    "fred\n",
    "```\n",
    "Bind parameters can be specified with string-based SQL, using a colon. To specify the values, use the params() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> session.query(User).filter(text(\"id<:value and name=:name\")).\\\n",
    "...     params(value=224, name='fred').order_by(User.id).one()\n",
    "<User(name='fred', fullname='Fred Flintstone', nickname='freddy')>\n",
    "```\n",
    "To use an entirely string-based statement, a `text()` construct representing a complete statement can be passed to from_statement(). Without additional specifiers, the columns in the string SQL are matched to the model columns based on name, such as below where we use just an asterisk to represent loading all columns:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> session.query(User).from_statement(\n",
    "...                     text(\"SELECT * FROM users where name=:name\")).\\\n",
    "...                     params(name='ed').all()\n",
    "[<User(name='ed', fullname='Ed Jones', nickname='eddie')>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Matching columns on name works for simple cases but can become unwieldy when dealing with complex statements that contain duplicate column names or when using anonymized ORM constructs that don’t easily match to specific names. Additionally, there is typing behavior present in our mapped columns that we might find necessary when handling result rows. For these cases, the text() construct allows us to link its textual SQL to Core or ORM-mapped column expressions positionally; we can achieve this by passing column expressions as positional arguments to the TextClause.columns() method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> stmt = text(\"SELECT name, id, fullname, nickname \"\n",
    "...             \"FROM users where name=:name\")\n",
    ">>> stmt = stmt.columns(User.name, User.id, User.fullname, User.nickname)\n",
    ">>> session.query(User).from_statement(stmt).params(name='ed').all()\n",
    "[<User(name='ed', fullname='Ed Jones', nickname='eddie')>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "New in version 1.1: The TextClause.columns() method now accepts column expressions which will be matched positionally to a plain text SQL result set, eliminating the need for column names to match or even be unique in the SQL statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "When selecting from a text() construct, the Query may still specify what columns and entities are to be returned; instead of query(User) we can also ask for the columns individually, as in any other case:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> stmt = text(\"SELECT name, id FROM users where name=:name\")\n",
    ">>> stmt = stmt.columns(User.name, User.id)\n",
    ">>> session.query(User.id, User.name).\\\n",
    "...          from_statement(stmt).params(name='ed').all()\n",
    "[(1, u'ed')]\n",
    "```\n",

    ">See also  \n",
    ">[Using Textual SQL](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/tutorial.html#sqlexpression-text) - The text() construct explained from the perspective of Core-only queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Counting\n",
    "Query includes a convenience method for counting called count():\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> session.query(User).filter(User.name.like('%ed')).count()\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ">Counting on count()\n",
    "Query.count() used to be a very complicated method when it would try to guess whether or not a subquery was needed around the existing query, and in some exotic cases it wouldn’t do the right thing. Now that it uses a simple subquery every time, it’s only two lines long and always returns the right answer. Use func.count() if a particular statement absolutely cannot tolerate the subquery being present.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `count()` method is used to determine how many rows the SQL statement would return. Looking at the generated SQL above, SQLAlchemy always places whatever it is we are querying into a subquery, then counts the rows from that. In some cases this can be reduced to a simpler SELECT count(*) FROM table, however modern versions of SQLAlchemy don’t try to guess when this is appropriate, as the exact SQL can be emitted using more explicit means.\n",
    "\n",
    "For situations where the “thing to be counted” needs to be indicated specifically, we can specify the “count” function directly using the expression func.count(), available from the func construct. Below we use it to return the count of each distinct user name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from sqlalchemy import func\n",
    ">>> session.query(func.count(User.name), User.name).group_by(User.name).all()\n",
    "[(1, u'ed'), (1, u'fred'), (1, u'mary'), (1, u'wendy')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve our simple SELECT count(*) FROM table, we can apply it as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> session.query(func.count('*')).select_from(User).scalar()\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "The usage of `select_from()` can be removed if we express the count in terms of the User primary key directly:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> session.query(func.count(User.id)).scalar()\n",

    "## Building a Relationship\n",

    "Let’s consider how a second table, related to User, can be mapped and queried. Users in our system can store any number of email addresses associated with their username. This implies a basic one to many association from the users to a new table which stores email addresses, which we will call addresses. Using declarative, we define this table along with its mapped class, Address:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from sqlalchemy import ForeignKey\n",

    "\n",
    "The above class introduces the ForeignKey construct, which is a directive applied to Column that indicates that values in this column should be constrained to be values present in the named remote column. This is a core feature of relational databases, and is the “glue” that transforms an otherwise unconnected collection of tables to have rich overlapping relationships. The ForeignKey above expresses that values in the addresses.user_id column should be constrained to those values in the users.id column, i.e. its primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second directive, known as relationship(), tells the ORM that the Address class itself should be linked to the User class, using the attribute Address.user. relationship() uses the foreign key relationships between the two tables to determine the nature of this linkage, determining that Address.user will be many to one. An additional relationship() directive is placed on the User mapped class under the attribute User.addresses. In both relationship() directives, the parameter relationship.back_populates is assigned to refer to the complementary attribute names; by doing so, each relationship() can make intelligent decision about the same relationship as expressed in reverse; on one side, Address.user refers to a User instance, and on the other side, User.addresses refers to a list of Address instances.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note\n",
    "The relationship.back_populates parameter is a newer version of a very common SQLAlchemy feature called relationship.backref. The relationship.backref parameter hasn’t gone anywhere and will always remain available! The relationship.back_populates is the same thing, except a little more verbose and easier to manipulate. For an overview of the entire topic, see the section Linking Relationships with Backref.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse side of a many-to-one relationship is always one to many. A full catalog of available relationship() configurations is at Basic Relationship Patterns.\n",

    "The two complementing relationships Address.user and User.addresses are referred to as a bidirectional relationship, and is a key feature of the SQLAlchemy ORM. The section Linking Relationships with Backref discusses the “backref” feature in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments to relationship() which concern the remote class can be specified using strings, assuming the Declarative system is in use. Once all mappings are complete, these strings are evaluated as Python expressions in order to produce the actual argument, in the above case the User class. The names which are allowed during this evaluation include, among other things, the names of all classes which have been created in terms of the declared base.\n",

    "## Querying with Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have two tables, we can show some more features of Query, specifically how to create queries that deal with both tables at the same time. The Wikipedia page on SQL JOIN offers a good introduction to join techniques, several of which we’ll illustrate here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a simple implicit join between User and Address, we can use Query.filter() to equate their related columns together. Below we load the User and Address entities at once using this method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> for u, a in session.query(User, Address).\\\n",
    "...                     filter(User.id==Address.user_id).\\\n",
    "...                     filter(Address.email_address=='jack@google.com').\\\n",
    "...                     all():\n",
    "...     print(u)\n",
    "...     print(a)\n",
    "<User(name='jack', fullname='Jack Bean', nickname='gjffdd')>\n",
    "<Address(email_address='jack@google.com')>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The actual SQL JOIN syntax, on the other hand, is most easily achieved using the Query.join() method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> session.query(User).join(Address).\\\n",
    "...         filter(Address.email_address=='jack@google.com').\\\n",
    "...         all()\n",
    "[<User(name='jack', fullname='Jack Bean', nickname='gjffdd')>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "`Query.join()` knows how to join between User and Address because there’s only one foreign key between them. If there were no foreign keys, or several, `Query.join()` works better when one of the following forms are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "query.join(Address, User.id==Address.user_id)    # explicit condition\n",
    "query.join(User.addresses)                       # specify relationship from left to right\n",
    "query.join(Address, User.addresses)              # same, with explicit target\n",
    "query.join('addresses')                          # same, using a string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you would expect, the same idea is used for “outer” joins, using the `outerjoin()` function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "query.outerjoin(User.addresses)   # LEFT OUTER JOIN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference documentation for `join()` contains detailed information and examples of the calling styles accepted by this method; join() is an important method at the center of usage for any SQL-fluent application.\n",
    "\n",
    ">What does Query select from if there’s multiple entities?\n",
    "The `Query.join()` method will typically join from the leftmost item in the list of entities, when the ON clause is omitted, or if the ON clause is a plain SQL expression. To control the first entity in the list of JOINs, use the `Query.select_from()` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "query = session.query(User, Address).select_from(Address).join(User)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "When querying across multiple tables, if the same table needs to be referenced more than once, SQL typically requires that the table be aliased with another name, so that it can be distinguished against other occurrences of that table. The Query supports this most explicitly using the aliased construct. Below we join to the Address entity twice, to locate a user who has two distinct email addresses at the same time:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from sqlalchemy.orm import aliased\n",
    ">>> adalias1 = aliased(Address)\n",
    ">>> adalias2 = aliased(Address)\n",
    ">>> for username, email1, email2 in \\\n",
    "...     session.query(User.name, adalias1.email_address, adalias2.email_address).\\\n",
    "...     join(adalias1, User.addresses).\\\n",
    "...     join(adalias2, User.addresses).\\\n",
    "...     filter(adalias1.email_address=='jack@google.com').\\\n",
    "...     filter(adalias2.email_address=='j25@yahoo.com'):\n",
    "...     print(username, email1, email2)\n",
    "jack jack@google.com j25@yahoo.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Subqueries\n",
    "The Query is suitable for generating statements which can be used as subqueries. Suppose we wanted to load User objects along with a count of how many Address records each user has. The best way to generate SQL like this is to get the count of addresses grouped by user ids, and JOIN to the parent. In this case we use a LEFT OUTER JOIN so that we get rows back for those users who don’t have any addresses, e.g.:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT users.*, adr_count.address_count FROM users LEFT OUTER JOIN\n",
    "    (SELECT user_id, count(*) AS address_count\n",
    "        FROM addresses GROUP BY user_id) AS adr_count\n",
    "    ON users.id=adr_count.user_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Query, we build a statement like this from the inside out. The statement accessor returns a SQL expression representing the statement generated by a particular Query - this is an instance of a select() construct, which are described in SQL Expression Language Tutorial:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from sqlalchemy.sql import func\n",
    ">>> stmt = session.query(Address.user_id, func.count('*').\\\n",
    "...         label('address_count')).\\\n",
    "...         group_by(Address.user_id).subquery()\n",
    "```\n",
    "The func keyword generates SQL functions, and the `subquery()` method on Query produces a SQL expression construct representing a SELECT statement embedded within an alias (it’s actually shorthand for query.statement.alias()).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our statement, it behaves like a Table construct, such as the one we created for users at the start of this tutorial. The columns on the statement are accessible through an attribute called c:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> for u, count in session.query(User, stmt.c.address_count).\\\n",
    "...     outerjoin(stmt, User.id==stmt.c.user_id).order_by(User.id):\n",
    "...     print(u, count)\n",
    "<User(name='ed', fullname='Ed Jones', nickname='eddie')> None\n",
    "<User(name='wendy', fullname='Wendy Williams', nickname='windy')> None\n",
    "<User(name='mary', fullname='Mary Contrary', nickname='mary')> None\n",
    "<User(name='fred', fullname='Fred Flintstone', nickname='freddy')> None\n",
    "<User(name='jack', fullname='Jack Bean', nickname='gjffdd')> 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting Entities from Subqueries\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we just selected a result that included a column from a subquery. What if we wanted our subquery to map to an entity ? For this we use aliased() to associate an “alias” of a mapped class to a subquery:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> stmt = session.query(Address).\\\n",
    "...                 filter(Address.email_address != 'j25@yahoo.com').\\\n",
    "...                 subquery()\n",
    ">>> adalias = aliased(Address, stmt)\n",
    ">>> for user, address in session.query(User, adalias).\\\n",
    "...         join(adalias, User.addresses):\n",
    "...     print(user)\n",
    "...     print(address)\n",
    "<User(name='jack', fullname='Jack Bean', nickname='gjffdd')>\n",
    "<Address(email_address='jack@google.com')>\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Using EXISTS\n",
    "The `EXISTS` keyword in SQL is a boolean operator which returns True if the given expression contains any rows. It may be used in many scenarios in place of joins, and is also useful for locating rows which do not have a corresponding row in a related table.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an explicit EXISTS construct, which looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from sqlalchemy.sql import exists\n",
    ">>> stmt = exists().where(Address.user_id==User.id)\n",
    ">>> for name, in session.query(User.name).filter(stmt):\n",
    "...     print(name)\n",
    "jack\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Query features several operators which make usage of EXISTS automatically. Above, the statement can be expressed along the User.addresses relationship using any():\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> for name, in session.query(User.name).\\\n",
    "...         filter(User.addresses.any()):\n",
    "...     print(name)\n",
    "jack\n",
    "```\n",
    "`any()` takes criterion as well, to limit the rows matched:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> for name, in session.query(User.name).\\\n",
    "...     filter(User.addresses.any(Address.email_address.like('%google%'))):\n",
    "...     print(name)\n",
    "jack\n",
    "```\n",
    "`has()` is the same operator as any() for many-to-one relationships (note the ~ operator here too, which means “NOT”):\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> session.query(Address).\\\n",
    "...         filter(~Address.user.has(User.name=='jack')).all()\n",
    "[]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Relationship Operators\n",
    "Here’s all the operators which build on relationships - each one is linked to its API documentation which includes full details on usage and behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__eq__()` (many-to-one “equals” comparison):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
